## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Python-Projects
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies for all projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Or install dependencies individually:**
```bash
# For basic projects (no extra dependencies needed)
# - hangman.py, tictactoegame.py, numberguessgame.py, wordguess.py
# - mazesolver.py, slotmachine.py, rockpaperscissor.py

# For Snake Game
pip install pygame

# For Image Displayer GUI
pip install PyQt5

# For PDF Merger
pip install PyPDF2

# For Password Manager
pip install cryptography

# For RoboTalker (choose one or more)
pip install pyttsx3  # Cross-platform TTS
pip install gtts     # Google TTS

# For Weather App
pip install requests
```

### Step 4: Run Projects
```bash
# Example: Run Hangman
python hangman.py

# Example: Run Snake Game
python snakegame.py
```

## üìù Notes
- For best experience, install all dependencies listed above.
- Some projects (like Snake, Image Displayer, PDF Merger) require additional libraries.
- For `robotalker.py`, Windows users can use `wsay.exe` (see [wsay](https://github.com/p-groarke/wsay)), or use `pyttsx3`/`gtts` for cross-platform support.
- The `doc/words.txt` file is required for the Word Guess game.
- Virtual environment is recommended to avoid conflicts with system Python packages.
